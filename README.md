# Baby Turtle Care Game 🐢

## Overview

**Baby Turtle Care** is an interactive game where players control a "caring turtle" tasked with keeping two baby turtles safe. The objective is to protect the baby turtles from going outside the safe area, as the outside is dangerous.

## Features

  - A caring turtle that the player controls.

- 🎮 **Gameplay Mechanics**:

  - The caring turtle must catch the baby turtles before they go out of bounds.
  - If the caring turtle goes outside before the end of working hours, it goes back to its initial position.
  - When the working hours end, you'll get the player's level of care and the appropriate message.

- 📊 **Score Tracking**:

  - If the player catches the baby turtle before it goes out of bounds, it will return to its initial position, and the player's level of care goes up.
  - If a baby turtle goes outside, it will return to its initial position, and the player's level of care goes down.
